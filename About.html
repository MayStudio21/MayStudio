        <h1>Hello, I'm Mathilde</h1>
        <p>Design is my passion, and I'm deeply committed to creating work that resonates with people. From branding to UX/UI, I thrive on turning ideas into designs that are not only visually compelling but also meaningful.</p>
        <p class="brief-history">
            I've always been drawn to creativity, especially through architecture and drawing. In high school, I had the chance to intern in both design and architecture, and it became clear that design was the path for me. It felt like the perfect balance of creativity and problem-solving.
            When deciding between studying psychology in France or design in Ireland, I chose design because, to me, it's all about understanding people-much like psychology. That connection drives my work, and it's what keeps me excited about my journey. Now, in my third year of studying design in Ireland, I'm more inspired than ever to keep learning and growing!

    <h2>My Approach</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Design for me is about finding solutions that connect users to brands. When I take on a new project, I instantly visualize potential outcomes and begin brainstorming the most effective design. I focus on refining ideas, pushing them to their best possible form. I'm a strong problem solver and enjoy tackling challenges, especially those outside my comfort zone. Even in areas where I'm less experienced, I embrace the opportunity to learn, experiment, and improve.</p>

        <section class="experience">
    <h2>Experience & Achievements</h2>
    <div class="experience-content">
        <p>During high school, I completed two internships-one at a design school and the other at an architecture agency in Paris. These early experiences provided me with hands-on exposure to the design field, allowing me to develop a strong understanding of the creative process and problem-solving in real-world scenarios. They fueled my passion for design and gave me a valuable foundation to build upon in my studies.</p>

        <p>At 18, I moved from France to Ireland to pursue my studies in design. This experience pushed me to embrace a new culture and language, and it helped me grow both personally and professionally. The challenges of adapting to a new environment sharpened my adaptability and deepened my curiosity, qualities that have continued to guide my journey as a designer.</p>

        <p>In addition to my academic path, I've worked in various roles, including as a childcare assistant and a waitress. These jobs taught me essential skills such as time management, clear communication, and working efficiently under pressure. They also helped me develop strong interpersonal skills, which are crucial when working with clients and colleagues in the design field.</p>

        <p>This summer, I'll be stepping into a second-in-command role, where I'll lead a team, make important decisions, and ensure the smooth running of operations. This opportunity will further develop my leadership and organizational abilities, skills that are transferable to my work in design and will help me thrive in collaborative environments.</p>
